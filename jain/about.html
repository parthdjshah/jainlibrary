<p>Jay Jinendra, I am Parth Shah, CA,CISA. 
<p>This site is a non-commercial website created and maintained by me only as Gyanseva toward our great Jain Philosophy.
<p>It started as a home project to help some site owners decoding non-Unicode fonts to Unicode Gujarati and Devanagari Fonts.
<p>Then I thought that it is always better to upload these shastras in Unicode fonts to a website as it will have following benefits:
<p><b>1) True Searchable:</b> Our Jain Scriptures are not uploaded online in a searchable format in Unicode text. I think this is first of its kind project with coverage of all Jain Aagams in Unicode text available online free of charge for education purpose.
<p><b>2) Reflowable: </b>Most of existing shashtras are in rigid pdf format which is very hard to read in small devices like phones. Hence, to make it more device friendly, I have provided EPUB copies of each of the books here, which is first of its kind.
<p><b>3) Artificial Intelligence:</b> I have a vision that one day these books in Unicode format can be fed into AI software to make them reasonably intelligent that they can resolve many of the doubts about Jainism for lay people.
<p><b>4) Conversion to Speech:</b> All Unicode text can be easily converted to speech / audio format so that even they can be heard hands free while driving or people with special abilities can use them. 
<p><b>5) Modernisation:</b> Since Jain documents would be available in electronic format, it would be easy for the new generation to get these documents.

<p>I hope this site will be helpful to many to shed light of Shrutgyan in the times of 5th TimeCycle(Ara).
